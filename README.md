# IRIS-Flower-Classification

## Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic example of a machine learning project that focuses on classifying iris flowers into three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This classification is based on four key features of the iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project employs various data science and machine learning techniques to analyze, visualize, and classify the iris flowers accurately.
